design goal:
    prog1.php -> prog2.php -> prog3.js/html

    event is captured by prog1, passed on to prog2 (via http_post) which pushes it db, 
    prog3 reads from the db, and renders it for display

problem: get the count of unread rows (like unread messages in whatsapp/unread email counts)
